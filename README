[README]
Gravity is a collection of categories, components, and utility methods brought together into a single library. I use this library for all of my iOS project to aid in development. It is named "Gravity" because it pulls in the most commonly used tidbits and puts them all together into a single library.

To install Gravity, follow the Apple Developer Guide for linking against static libraries here: https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/iOSStaticLibraries/Articles/configuration.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012554-CH3-SW1
