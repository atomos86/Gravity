This document will soon be updated with much better instruction. For now, here are my crib notes on how to install Gravity as a static library with Xcode 4 using a Workspace.

How to setup Gravity as Static Linked Library

• Add git submodule
• Create workspace, add Gravity and the new project using it. 
• Create a library dependency by selecting the the new project, Build Phase, Link with Libraries. 
Add the libGravity.a file
• Add user search paths
- Click Build Settings, in the search type 'user header'
- Add this line to the "User Header Search Paths": 
  "$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/../../Headers"
- Set 'Always Search Header Paths' to YES
• Add Gravity to the new project's scheme.
- Edit Scheme, Choose Build. Click + and add Gravity. Drag Gravity to be above the application target. Check both "Run" and "Archive".
• Import <Gravity/Gravity.h> to classes needing the framework, or your pch file.
• Start using Gravity!
